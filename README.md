## I'm a Computational Scientist / Physicist

 - I'm currently working on local embedding methods for Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2019, 15, 7, 3949â€“3959](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b01244)
 - I'm also working on the treatment of spin-orbit coupling in *ab initio* AFQMC calculations
