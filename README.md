## I'm a Computational Scientist / Physicist

 - 🤔 I'm currently working on local embedding methods for Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2019, 15, 7, 3949–3959](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b01244)
 - 🤔 I'm also working on the treatment of spin-orbit coupling in *ab initio* AFQMC calculations. [J. Chem. Phys. 156, 014107 (2022)](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0075900)

## I'm also an Application Security Enthusiast:

  - ***NEW*** :🔭See my AppSec project [Bad Apps : Blog](https://github.com/bkesk/bad-apps-blog), a blog web application where I practice implementing useful features while following secure design / coding best practices.
  - 🏁 See my Capture the Flag (CTF) 🏁 writeups on my blog, [7UR7L3Blog](https://7ur7l3blog.tech/), for more!
